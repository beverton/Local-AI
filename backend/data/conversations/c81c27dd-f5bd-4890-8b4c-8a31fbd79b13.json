Here are some common fruit-bearing trees or plants and their approximate growing periods:\n\n1. Durian (Durio spp.): This tropical fruit can take up to 6 years before producing its first fruit, but it may take longer for the tree to reach full maturity and produce consistently large yields.\n2.",

Here is a list of five fruits that typically have long growth periods from plantation to harvest:\n1) Durian - It takes around 3 to 7 years for durian trees to bear their first fruit. However, they might not start yielding significant harvests until after ten years.\n\n2) Pineapple – While pineapples themselves do not take long to mature (around 18 months), commercial pineapple farms require several years to establish and cultivate the fields properly.",
